# Specialized-Architectural-Approach-for-Agentic-AI-System-for-Codebase
> The primary objective is to engineer a system that can reliably perform transformation—translating the abstract requirements of the new spec into concrete, executable code modifications.

**To achive this we have to combine 3 necessory elements:**
```

- Hybrid ReAct Loop
- Sophisticated Agentic AI System
- Plan and Execute Workflow

```
---

### 1. Hybrid ReAct Loop
Here we much employe Hybrid agent architecture which uses Reasoning and Action (ReAct) framework. This is essential because the there are 2 tasks requires alternating between:
 - high-level intellectual work (comparing specs, generating code logic)
 - low-level execution (editing files, running tests)
### 2. Sophisticated Agentic AI System
### 3. Plan and Execute Workflow
